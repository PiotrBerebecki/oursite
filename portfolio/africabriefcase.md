##Challenge
IC publications needed a service which would allow their freelance journalists, working around the world, to create journalistic material. They needed their editors to be able to curate and publish that material in beautiful collections of articles.

##Solution
After the production of meticulous wireframes and user stories, the project began with the production of an alpha application. Starting from this foundation, the team worked in fortnightly sprints, using agile principles until completion. Our processes ensured quality, timing and flexibility.

Founders and Coders are continuing to expand this platform as our clients’ needs develop.
