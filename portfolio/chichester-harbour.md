#Chichester Harbour

A customer relationship system (CRM) for membership management, events booking and subscription payments for the Friends of Chichester Harbor.

##Challenge
The Friends of Chichester Harbor needed a bespoke platform for managing their many offerings.

##Solution
After wireframing and user stories, the team worked in weekly agile sprints until completion.

##Results
A beautiful and easy to use customer relationship system. Built mobile first as and as a hybrid between a single web page application and normal web application.

The project uses Virtual Dom for faster dom rendering and a better mobile experience. Virtual Dom, unlike angular, does not impose a stucture. Virtual Dom allowed the team the freedom to build a small framwork which acts as a platform for the finished product.
