## Why
Founders and Coders has a lot of tallented people doing great work but our current website fails to show any of our amazing projects and doesn't say much about the individuals involved. Building a new one will allow us to show off a bit and might improve our chances of getting interesting projects to work on.

## What
A website to showcase our work, our company and our school.
