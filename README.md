# Our website

## Why
<p>Founders and Coders has a lot of tallented people doing great work but our current website fails to show any of our amazing projects and does not say much about the individuals involved. Building a new one will allow us all to show off a bit and might improve our chances of getting interesting projects to work on.</p>

## What
<p>A website to showcase our work, our company and our school.</p>

## How
<p>Get involved! https://github.com/foundersandcoders/oursite/issues</p>

<!-- <h3>Our new site is under construction here. Input is wanted and everything is up for discussion</h3>

<p>Some initial ideas</p>

<p>We need a site which acts both as a face for our work and a face for our school. How this sits, is not completely clear. Do we want our left foot forward or a right? As we're not having any trouble getting great applicants - and as it may not be detrimental to the school for it to sit it behind the face of a great agency - agency first might be the way forward. <i>Any thoughts?</i></p>


<p>Note: We may want to do something cleaver with search queries, to decide what people see first when they search for us (e.g. Google search for 'Cheap MVP' leads to a different part of the site than 'Free coding bootcamp'). </p>

<p><i>Running with the agency first idea<i></p>

<h3>Landing page</h3>
<p>Strong image showing some of us at work</p>
<p>A company tagline, "We craft software to change the world" (Ideas please!)</p>
<p>Straight into portfolio. Maybe a typical block design e.g. http://lukashaider.com/</p>
<p>'Get in touch'</p>
<p><i>Do we want something about training on our landing page, or should we keep this seperate?</i></p>
