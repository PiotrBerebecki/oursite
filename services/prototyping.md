<a name="FAQ2">
*What sort of prototypes do you build?*     
We build web applications. In other words, software applications that run in a web browser.

<a name="FAQ3">
*What about mobile phone apps, for iPhone and Android?*     
We are certainly capable of this, but it's generally not something we do for a protoype. In most cases, it is better to build a prototype as a web app first, but we can do follow-up work to convert a web app into a native phone app.

<a name="FAQ4">
*Why isn't the price ten times higher?*    
As well as being an agency of developers, we are also a coding school. Prototype projects are generally undertaken by our recent graduate developers as an opportunity to showcase their capabilities, with the aim of being commissioned for further work from satisfied clients or even being offered employment. But rest assured that all graduates are able to draw on the experience and resources of the wider agency: all code goes though extensive testing and is reviewed by developers not involved in the project as an extra layer of qualty assurance.    

<a name="FAQ5">
*What’s the first step?*     
You get in touch with us and we'll invite you to discuss your idea with us at our campus in Bethnal Green. It is important we understand your idea, what you want to achieve, and if or when you are likely to want any follow-up work done. If you wish, you can bring a visual presentation too.

<a name="FAQ6">
*What happens next?*     
If our developers agree that we have a realistic chance of delivering a useful prototype that will meet your expectations, then we'll arrange a follow-up meeting with you to agree on a *minimum set of deliverables*, after which we will allocate you the first available start date that is convenient for you and request permission to raise an invoice.

<a name="FAQ7">
*Why do I have to pay before work starts?*    
Demand for our prototyping service outstrips supply and we need to know that clients are committed to the process before we can confirm a date for work to start. But the agency holds payment until the project is complete - money is not paid out to the development team until the successful delivery of the prototype. 

<a name="FAQ8">
*What happens if I'm not happy with the work done?*     
If the prototype does not meet the agreed specification, then you can request a full refund and your development team will not be paid.

<a name="FAQ9">
*What is my involvement in the process?*     
You will be the *product owner* for your project. On the first day of the build you will be expected to work together with your team to develop a series of *user journeys*, *wireframes* and *user stories*.  You will then continue to communicate with your team throughout using *Pivotal Tracker™*. Finally, you will join them at the end of the project for a presentation and handover.  

<a name="FAQ10">
*Wireframes?? Pivotal Tracker?? What training will I receive?*    
On the first day, you will receive a full day of training and practice in *product management*, *user experience design* and *agile development*. You will get an opportunity to work with your development team to produce *user journeys*, *wireframes* and *user stories* and you will be introduced to *agile project management* using *Pivotal Tracker™*. Throughout the rest of the project, you will be able to practise what you have learnt in the role of *product owner* for your project. 

<a name="FAQ11">
*What benefits will I get from the process?*     
You will improve your understanding of the software development process and your ability to manage teams of software developers. You will get training and experience in key aspects of product management and user experience design. You will get your own dedicated development team for the length of the project. You will receive a fully-documented prototype at the end of the process.

<a name="FAQ12">
*What happens if I want further work done on my prototype?*    
If you are happy with the prototype, you can retain some or all of your development team to continue to work on it for you.
