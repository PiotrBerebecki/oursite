**Who is this programme suitable for?**    
There are no academic requirements, but not everyone will be suited to the style of learning our programme requires. You need to be self-motivated, prepared to work long hours, and committed to collaborative working. Coding also requires a deep curiosity about how things work and a certain stubbornness in the face of repeated failure.

We need to know that you are serious about becoming a software developer before you start.

There are no fees.

We are trying to build a community and we do not think we can do that by charging an entry fee.
