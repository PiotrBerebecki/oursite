# A Prototype for £500

## Are you...

+ **A startup looking to create an MVP?**
+ **A business looking to test out a new idea?**
+ **A commissioning organisation looking to increase in-house expertise?**

## What you receive

+ **Your own product development team for up to one week.**
+ **Practical training in product management.**
+ **A working prototype.**

*Who is this service for?    
Companies that want to give our graduate developers an opportunity to demonstrate their capabilities, with a view to commissioning further work from them or offering them employment.

*What sort of prototypes do you build?*     
We build web applications. In other words, software applications that runs in a web browser.

*What can I realistically expect?*     
You can expect a working prototype or a *minimum viable product*. You would not normally expect to get a complete finished product in a week.

*What’s the first step?*     
We will invite you to discuss your idea with us at our campus in Bethnal Green. It is important we understand your idea, what you want to achieve, and when and if you are likely to want any follow up work done. If you wish, you can bring a visual presentation, too. Discussions usually take place on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 5.30pm.

*What happens next?*     
If our developers agree that we have a realistic chance of delivering a useful prototype for you, then we will arrange a follow-up meeting with you to agree on a *minimum set of deliverables*, after which we will allocate you the first available start date that is convenient for you and request permission to raise an invoice.

*Why do I have to pay before work starts?*    
Demand for our prototyping service outstrips supply and we need to know that clients are committed to the process before we can copnfirm a date for work to start.

*What is my involvement in the process?*     
You will be the *product owner* for your project. On the first day of the build you will be expected to work together with your team to develop a series of *user journeys*, *wireframes* and *user stories*.  You will then continue to communicate with your team throughout the week using *Pivotal Tracker™*. Finally, you will join them at the end of the week for a project presentation and handover.

*What training will I receive?*    
On the first day, you will receive a full day of training and practice in *product management*, *user experience design* and *agile development*. You will get an opportunity to work with your development team to produce *user journeys*, *wireframes* and *user stories* and you will be introduced to *agile project management* using *Pivotal Tracker™*. Throughout the rest of the week, you will be able to practice what you have learnt in the role of *product owner* for your project. 

*What benefits will I get from the process?*     
You will improve your understanding of the software development process and your ability to manage teams of software developers. You will get training and experience in key aspects of product management and user experience design. You will get your own dedicated development team for the length of the project. You will receive a fully-documented prototype at the end of the process.

*Do you also build iPhone and Android apps?*     
Generally, not for a protoype. In most cases, it is better to build a prototype as a web app first, but we can do follow-up work to convert a web app into a native phone app.

*What happens if I am not happy with the work done?*     
If the prototype does not meet the agreed specification, then you can request a full refund and your development team will not be paid.

*What happens if I want further work done on my prototype?*    
If you are happy with the prototype, you can retain some or all of your development team to continue to work on it for you. Our freelance rates start at £80/day (equivalent to the London Living Wage).

*How do I find out more?*
