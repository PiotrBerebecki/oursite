## The programme

Founders & Coders runs what is probably the most challenging course of its kind in the UK: An eight-week, full-time foundation course in software development for the Web, followed by a further eight weeks building a portfolio and then the possibility of an apprenticeship as a member of the Founders & Coders freelance co-operative.

Applications for the next course are now open. [Apply here](/apply)
