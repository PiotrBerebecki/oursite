# Training 

We offer a variety of tailored courses, from single-day workshops to eight-week full-time bootcamps.

Our courses are suitable for a variety of users, including:

+ Complete beginners
+ Graduate trainees
+ Industry professionals

We offer training in:

+ Full-stack Web development 
+ Front-end Web development 
+ UX / Product management

Our general approach is:

+ Agile
+ Test-driven
+ Team-based

Our primary programming language of choice is JavaScript and our primary server-side platform is Node.js.

## Pedagogy 

We do not see ourselves as teachers, but as facilitators of peer-based learning.   

We get students to learn through working on real-world projects. We organise our students into groups. We encourage sharing of knowledge both within and between groups.   

Students are given roles within each group and are expected to develop domain expertise, which they then share with their fellow students through student-led seminars.  

Each group is expected to review each othersâ€™ work on a daily basis and to present their projects to the whole class at the end of each week.  

Throughout our courses, we supplement the project-based learning with structured paired-programming exercises using a series of increasingly advanced challenges.  

We introduce our students to CSS frameworks, like Twitter Bootstrap, front-end libraries, like jQuery and React, and application frameworks, like Express and hapi, by encouraging them to build there own versions of these libraries before actually using them, so as to better understand how they work, and when, why and how to use them.

Students usually learn in groups of 4 and classes of 16. This ensures that all students get to know each other well and that the classroom can develop a cohesive group identity. Larger groups are accommodated by splitting each cohort into two or more classes.  

Course syllabuses closely follow the format and content of our core programme in software development taught at our Bethnal Green campus.  

All our staff are software developers who have taught on and contributed to our core programme. They bring an unusual degree of ability, enthusiasm and experience to their work, which is shared by everyone at *Founders & Coders*.

## Why JavaScript?

We love many languages, including C, Python, Ruby, Perl, Lisp, Go and Haskell, but JavaScript is the language of the Web. You cannot be a front-end Web developer without knowing JavaScript. With the arrival into the mainstream of Node.js, JavaScipt is now an excellent choice for back-end Web development. And with new technologies like PhoneGap and now Facebook's React library, it can be used for iPhone and Android development, too. If you want to be a Web developer, JavaScript will be useful to you wherever you go.

In general, we have found that employers are often reluctant to employ inexperienced junior developers to work on their server-side application software. As a result, graduates of our training programmes have found it easier to find work as front-end developers and that means that *in almost every case* JavaScript is the language that they need to learn to break into the job market.

We have previously attempted to introduce two or more languages into our introductory courses, and have for example used Python extensively in previous courses, but this is not unlike attempting to offer a language immersion course simultaneously in French and German; It is likely to confuse introductory-level students and diminish their ability to make progress in either language.
