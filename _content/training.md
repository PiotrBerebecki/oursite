## Pedagogy 

We do not see ourselves as teachers, but as facilitators of peer-based learning.   

We get students to learn through working on real-world projects. We organise our students into groups. We encourage sharing of knowledge both within and between groups.   

Students are given roles within each group and are expected to develop domain expertise, which they then share with their fellow students through student-led seminars.  

Each group is expected to review each othersâ€™ work on a daily basis and to present their projects to the whole class at the end of each week.  

Throughout our courses, we supplement the project-based learning with structured paired-programming exercises using a series of increasingly advanced challenges.  

We introduce our students to CSS frameworks, like Twitter Bootstrap, front-end libraries, like jQuery and React, and application frameworks, like Express and hapi, by encouraging them to build there own versions of these libraries before actually using them, so as to better understand how they work.

Students usually learn in groups of 4 and classes of 16. This ensures that all students get to know each other well and that the classroom can develop a cohesive group identity. Larger groups are accommodated by splitting each cohort into two or more classes.  

Course syllabuses closely follow the format and content of our core programme in software development taught at our Bethnal Green campus.  

All our staff are software developers who have taught on and contributed to our core programme. They bring an unusual degree of ability, enthusiasm and experience to their work, which is shared by everyone at Founders & Coders.
