# About us

*Founders & Coders C.I.C.* is a not-for-profit social enterprise and freelance co-operative founded in January 2015. We develop both software and educational programmes. 

Our innovative training programme and software apprenticeship, in its first year of operation, is already greatly over-subscribed and attracts applications from all over London, the rest of  the UK and abroad.

Our digital agency, which employs the graduates of our training programme, specialises in developing software applications for both Web and mobile.

All of our profits go back into improving the quality of our training programmes and supporting our graduates into employment.
