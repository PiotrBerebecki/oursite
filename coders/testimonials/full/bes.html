<p>There is something incredibly powerful about working in small teams on ambitious open-ended projects. It plays with our core sensibilities—our fundamentals. We are social animals. Our fear of letting others down, our desire to compete, our ability to learn through watching, doing and—eventually—teaching. There are many institutions that operate in a similar way but very few of them are educational. Schools and universities split people up, for sorting and testing. This one-dimensional isolating way of learning is a mistake. The model of teaching at Founders &amp; Coders is different and a significant improvement.</p>
