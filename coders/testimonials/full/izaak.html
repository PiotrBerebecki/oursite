<p>Founders &amp; Coders was everything I wanted university to be and is becoming everything I want my work life to be. I am surrounded by passionate people, who are excited by what theyâ€™re doing. I spend my days learning difficult things, with a great amount of support and a real sense of progress. My lunchtimes are spent having interesting conversations, with interesting people, from all over the world. I meet potential employers, partners and clients on a weekly basis. Everything feels like progress and we are having such a good time.</p>
