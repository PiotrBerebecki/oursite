		<h1>The programme</h1><p><img src="/assets/fac-logo.png" class="fac-logo"></p>
<p>Founders &amp; Coders runs an intensive full-time, 16-week course in full-stack software development using JavaScript and Node.js. Application is highly-selective and we take just 16 students per cohort. After graduation, we expect all of our students to help us deliver the course to the next cohort and to contribute to our various community projects.</p>

		<div id="apply"></div>
		<h1>Applications</h1><p>The Spring 2017 programme starts on Monday 20th February. </p>
<p>Applications will open on November 1st and close on November 30th.</p>
<h2>The application process</h2><ul>
<li><strong><a href="interest.html">Expression of interest</a></strong> - takes two minutes to complete.</li>
<li>Application - opening on November 1st.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will expect you to have started on your journey to become a software developer before you join us on the programme.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways to demonstrate your readiness for the programme:</p>
<ul>
<li>Completing and creating JavaScript kata on <a href="http://www.codewars.com/?language=javascript">Codewars</a></li>
<li>Making progress with <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com/">Free Code Camp</a> *</li>
<li>Creating your own website using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a> *</li>
<li>Participation in one of our <a href="http://www.meetup.com/founderscoders/">Meetup groups</a></li>
</ul>
<p>* While learning CSS and JavaScript, we recommend against using frameworks like Bootstrap and jQuery.</p>
<p>We have no minimum criteria for application, but you are unlikely to secure a place on the programme without a considerable amount of prior effort. 100-200 hours of self-study is probably typical. </p>
<p>5kyu or more on Codewars or, alternatively, completing <em>Advanced Algorithm Scripting</em> and some of the <em>Advanced Front End Development Projects</em> on Free Code Camp would be good targets to aim for.</p>
<p>If you are not comfortable coding at this standard by the time the course starts you may struggle. The tasks above are part of how we will measure whether you are a good candidate for the course as well as whether you can learn in the collaborative environment here. </p>
<p>If you have no coding experience, we encourage you to seek help and encouragement from our online community on  <a href="https://gitter.im/codingforeveryone">Gitter</a>. It&#39;s a friendly place. Beginners are always welcome.  </p>
<p>Please be aware that meeting our suggested targets will not necessarily secure you a place. Our programme is highly collaborative and we take great care to achieve a diversity of skills and backgrounds on each cohort. Our aim is to create the best <em>team</em> learning environment for every cohort, not to simply have a set of great <em>individuals</em>.</p>

		<h2>Other recommended materials</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/dwyl/dev-setup">A Guide to setting up your developer environment</a> by our good friends at dwyl is an excellent starting point for new developers.</p>
<p>Udacity has several good courses, including <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-basics--ud804">JavaScript Basics</a>, <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/object-oriented-javascript--ud015">Object-Oriented JavaScript</a> and <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775">How to Use Git and GitHub</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> is another good resource for beginners.

<p><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing">Khan Academy</a> is another great resource for complete beginners. We love their introduction to Computer Science as well as their JavaScript-based programming course.</p>
<p><a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/Eloquent_JavaScript.pdf">Eloquent Javascript</a> is a great self-contained introduction to Javascript. The first 4 chapters are relatively easy to follow. Subsequent chapters cover more advanced topics.</p>
<p><a href="http://bdcampbell.net/javascript/book/javascript_the_good_parts.pdf">Javascript: The Good Parts</a> is written by the God of Javascript, Douglas Crockford, but later chapters can also be hard to follow.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxAXlJEmNMg&amp;list=PL7664379246A246CB">Crockford on JavaScript</a>, particularly Parts 2 and 3. A wonderful series of lectures by Crockford. A panoramic overview of JavaScript at an advanced level. These talks are hard to follow, but anything you can take from them is valuable.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/Bv_5Zv5c-Ts">JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts - The First 3.5 Hours</a>. The full course is on Udemy, but the first bit is free on YouTube and well worth watching.</p>
<p><a href="http://flukeout.github.io/">CSS Diner</a> is a fun way to reinforce CSS selectors.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.typingclub.com/">Typing Club</a> is good (and free). It would help greatly for you to be a relatively quick typist. </p>
<p>Finally, sign up to Stack Overflow and look at some answers given for Javascript questions. The community can be a little intolerant of duplicated questions, but it is really worth the effort of trying to ask (or even answer!) some questions yourself.</p>
<h2>Extras</h2><p><strong>Reading</strong><br><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/">Paul Ford - What is Code?</a> is a great article about his impression of the tech industry and the life of a programmer. It&#39;s long, but quite light to read.</p>
<p><a href="https://plus.google.com/+RipRowan/posts/eVeouesvaVX">Steve Yegge&#39;s Google platforms rant</a> shows you how passionate someone can be about their tech company&#39;s philosophy.</p>

		<div id="faq"></div>
		<h1>FAQ</h1><p><strong>What is the Founders &amp; Coders programme?</strong><br>It is a 16-week programme of study in software development for the web.  </p>
<p><strong>How frequently do your programmes run?</strong><br>We run three programmes a year, starting in February, June, and October. Exact dates will be confirmed nearer the time, so check back regularly for updates.  </p>
<p><strong>What is the aim of the programme?</strong><br>To give students sufficient skills to create web applications and find employment as a web developer.</p>
<p><strong>What is the programme length?</strong><br>It consists of a 10-week foundation followed by 5 weeks working on real-world projects, separated by a reading week (two weeks, for the Autumn cohort). The total course length is 16 weeks (17 weeks for the Autumn cohort).</p>
<p><strong>How is the foundation course delivered?</strong><br>As a full-time classroom-based course running Monday to Friday from 10am to 7pm at our campus in Bethnal Green.</p>
<p><strong>How is the classroom organised?</strong><br>Classes are peer-led and project-based with sixteen students working in four teams of four. Students take turns to deliver seminars, run code reviews and manage projects.</p>
<p><strong>What does the curriculum cover?</strong><br>Primarily, we cover <em>test-driven</em> development, using <em>JavaScript</em> and <em>Node.js</em>. We also cover aspects of UX design, product management and entrepreneurship.</p>
<p><strong>What projects will I work on in the second part of the programme?</strong><br>We aim to give you an opportunity to work on a variety of open source, charitable and social enterprise projects. The programme is under continuous development and the balance between learning and creating useful software is under continuous review.  </p>
<p><strong>Will I be able to earn a living as after I complete the programme?</strong><br>We cannot offer you any guarantees, but the employment success rate of recent alumni is very high. We will do everything that we can to help you find freelance projects on completion of the programme and full-time employment when you are ready to move on.</p>
<p><strong>What are the main reasons to apply for this programme?</strong><br>The quality of the learning experience. The commitment of your fellow students. The <em>Founders &amp; Coders</em> community.</p>
<p><strong>Who is this programme suitable for?</strong><br>There are no academic requirements, but you need to be self-motivated, prepared to work long hours, and committed to collaborative working. Coding also requires a deep curiosity about how things work and a certain stubbornness in the face of repeated failure. </p>
<p><strong>Do you accept applications from abroad?</strong><br>We do welcome international students onto the programme as long as they are intending to stay and work in London after they graduate. The programme is provided free and in return we expect you to contribute to our community. You will need to be eligible to study and work in the UK. We are currently unable to provide assistance with visas or accommodation.  </p>
<p><strong>Why are the prerequisites so tough?</strong><br>This programme is challenging and you need to be well-prepared. We aim for a zero drop-out rate, so we need to know that you are serious about becoming a developer before we accept you on to the programme. </p>
<p><strong>How competitive is the entry?</strong><br>Very. We get many applicants for each place.</p>
<p><strong>How much does it cost?</strong><br>There are no fees, but graduates are expected to contribute to the sustainability of the programme after they graduate.</p>
<p><strong>How are students expected to <em>contribute to the sustainability of the programme</em>?</strong><br>By delivering the programme to the next student cohort and by allowing us find them employment after they graduate.</p>
<p><strong>How are you supporting yourselves?</strong><br>Primarily, through fees earned from employers, but also from voluntary contributions from graduates who choose to find their own employment.</p>
<p><strong>If this programme is so good, why are you offering it for free?</strong><br>We are trying to build a community and we do not think we can do that by charging an entry fee.</p>

		<div id="why"></div>
		<h1>Why JavaScript?</h1><p>We love many languages, including C, Python, Ruby, Perl, Lisp, Go and Haskell, but JavaScript is the language of the Web. You cannot be a front-end Web developer without knowing JavaScript. With the arrival into the mainstream of Node.js, JavaScript is now an excellent choice for back-end Web development. And with new technologies like <em>PhoneGap</em> and now Facebook&#39;s <em>React</em> library, it can be used for <em>iPhone</em> and <em>Android</em> development, too. If you want to be a Web developer, JavaScript will be useful to you wherever you go.</p>
