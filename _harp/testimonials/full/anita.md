I found my passion for coding during a trip to Argentina. I knew that this was the career for me. The thing with passion is that you just want to know everything as soon as possible. I began to self learn using various tutorials and spending a small fortune on books. However, I still felt a sense of frustration that I wasn't moving any further to where I wanted to be. That's when I came across Founders & Coders. At first, I was sceptical: a 16-week course in javascriptâ€”for free. It was almost too good to be true.

Applying for the course was straightforward. This was a relief for me, as normally applying for a course has several stages with painful amounts of writing and interviews, whereas the Founders & Coders application process was straight to the point. After a few weeks I received confirmation that I had been accepted onto the course, and, well, what can I say other than it's changed my life.

The course was intense, however as a group we all built a support network, enabling us to learn from each other and support each other when needed. The amount of knowledge I have gained from Founders & Coders is immeasurable. There is no way I could have learnt what I did in such a short space of time on my own.

But that's not even the best bit! After several weeks free intensive learning, we were then able to sign up to build web apps for clients, which come through Founders & Coders, and get paid to do so!!

For me, the future looks so much brighter and that's all thanks to Founders & Coders.

I plan to stay around as long as possible.
