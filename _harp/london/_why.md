# Why JavaScript?

We love many languages, including C, Python, Ruby, Perl, Lisp, Go and Haskell, but JavaScript is the language of the Web. You cannot be a front-end Web developer without knowing JavaScript. With the arrival into the mainstream of Node.js, JavaScript is now an excellent choice for back-end Web development. And with new technologies like *PhoneGap* and now Facebook's *React* library, it can be used for *iPhone* and *Android* development, too. If you want to be a Web developer, JavaScript will be useful to you wherever you go.
