**Will I be able to earn a living as after I complete the programme?**  
We cannot offer you any guarantees, but the employment success rate of recent alumni is very high. We will do everything that we can to help you find freelance projects on completion of the programme and full-time employment when you are ready to move on.

**What are the main reasons to apply for this programme?**     
The quality of the learning experience. The commitment of your fellow students. The *Founders & Coders* community.

**Who is this programme suitable for?**    
There are no academic requirements, but you need to be self-motivated, prepared to work long hours, and committed to collaborative working. Coding also requires a deep curiosity about how things work and a certain stubbornness in the face of repeated failure. 

**Do you accept applications from abroad?**  
We do welcome international students onto the programme as long as they are intending to stay and work in London after they graduate. The programme is provided free and in return we expect you to contribute to our community. You will need to be eligible to study and work in the UK. We are currently unable to provide assistance with visas or accommodation.  

**Why are the prerequisites so tough?**    
This programme is challenging and you need to be well-prepared. We aim for a zero drop-out rate, so we need to know that you are serious about becoming a developer before we accept you on to the programme. 

**How competitive is the entry?**    
Very. We get many applicants for each place.

**How much does it cost?**     
There are no fees, but graduates are expected to contribute to the sustainability of the programme after they graduate.

**How are students expected to *contribute to the sustainability of the programme*?**     
By delivering the programme to the next student cohort and by allowing us find them employment after they graduate.

**How are you supporting yourselves?**    
Primarily, through fees earned from employers, but also from voluntary contributions from graduates who choose to find their own employment.

**If this programme is so good, why are you offering it for free?**    
We are trying to build a community and we do not think we can do that by charging an entry fee.
