# The Founders programme

### For entrepreneurs and organisations that want to build digital services

> “Working with Founders & Coders has been an awesome experience. The work we've done together on FUSE has meant leading charities have been able to access great developers and build products that are used in the real world with real people to make a real social impact.”

Our immersive one-week Founders programme helps organisations rapidly develop the expertise they need to build digital products and services.

With workshops on lean thinking, user testing, sprint planning and product ownership, and with a dedicated team of developers, we will engage your whole organisation in the creative process of designing and developing digital products.

## Partners

With  [CAST](http://www.wearecast.org.uk/), which runs the UK's first digital charity accelerator, we have paired individual charities with teams of developers to help them develop their expertise in managing software projects and to create real solutions to their organisational challenges.

With the  [Anna Freud Centre](http://www.annafreud.org/), we have developed a digital accelerator programme for health professionals, designed to nurture creative thinking and develop the most promising ideas into working software applications.

> “Founders & Coders manage to turn a room of mental health professionals, into a room of development-savvy product owners within mere hours. We’re looking forward to working with them to continue to innovate within the mental health sector."
