## Partnerships

With the [Anna Freud Centre](http://www.annafreud.org/), we have developed a digital accelerator programme for mental health professionals, designed to nurture creative thinking and develop the most promising ideas into working software applications. 

With [CAST](http://www.wearecast.org.uk/), which runs the UK's first digital charity accelerator, we have paired individual charities with teams of developers to help them develop their expertise in managing software projects and to create real solutions to their organisational challenges.
