## Minimum application requirements

We will expect you to have started on your journey to become a software developer before you join us on the programme. As a minimum, before you join us in October, we will expect you to:

+ Be proficient in spoken English;
+ Be familiar with the JavaScript programming language;
+ Reach at least 5 kyu on [Codewars](http://www.codewars.com/?language=javascript).

We also expect you to become active in our online community on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/codingforeveryone). We encourage you to start by asking questions. It's a friendly community. Beginners are always welcome.  

If you are not familiar with the JavaScript programming language, then before you start on Codewars, we recommend an introductory course in JavaScript. We suggest taking a look at the [Partner tutorials that teach JavaScript](https://code.org/learn), such as [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/hour-of-code/hour-of-drawing-code/v/welcome-hour-of-code) or [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/hour-of-code).
