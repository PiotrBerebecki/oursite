## Minimum application requirements

We will expect you to have started on your journey to become a software developer before you join us on the programme. As a minimum, before you join us in October, we will expect you to:

+ Be proficient in spoken English;
+ Be familiar with the JavaScript programming language;
+ Reach 5 kyu on [Codewars](http://www.codewars.com/?language=javascript).

If you are not familiar with the JavaScript programming language, then before you start on Codewars, we recommend an introductory course in JavaScript. 

We suggest you take a look at the [Partner tutorials that teach JavaScript](https://code.org/learn) on code.org, such as [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/hour-of-code/hour-of-drawing-code/v/welcome-hour-of-code) or [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/hour-of-code). We also recommend the [JavaScript Basics course](https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-basics--ud804) on Udacity.
