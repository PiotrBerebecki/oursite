# The programme

<img src="/assets/fac-logo.png" class="fac-logo">

This programme is being run in partnership with the UK Israel Tech Hub at the British Embassy in Tel Aviv.

We are inviting two outstanding candidates from the Arab Israeli community to join us in London for six months to participate in the Founders & Coders software development training programme, expenses paid, first as a student and then as a mentor. You will then return with us to run the first ever Founders & Coders programme in Israel in April 2017.

We will expect you to become a key member of the Founders & Coders team in Israel in 2017. By this time next year you will be an accomplished software developer and a recognised member of the Arab Israeli tech and startup community.

You do not need to have a background in computer science, but you do need to be self-motivated, prepared to work long hours, committed to collaborative working, and passionate about using technology to make the world a better place.

Founders & Coders is a friendly and safe environment open for all. Approximately half of all our students are women.
