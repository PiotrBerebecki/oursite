# The programme

<img src="/assets/fac-logo.png" class="fac-logo">

This programme is being run in partnership with the UK Israel Tech Hub at the British Embassy in Tel Aviv.

We are inviting two outstanding candidates from the Arab Israeli community to join us in London for 10 weeks to participate in the Founders & Coders software development training programme, expenses paid. 

You will then return with a team from London to help set up the first ever Founders & Coders programme in the city of Nazareth in January 2017.

You do not need to have a background in computer science, but you do need to speak English, be self-motivated, prepared to work long hours, committed to collaborative working, and be passionate about using technology to make the world a better place.

Founders & Coders is a friendly and safe environment open for all. Approximately half of all our students are women.
