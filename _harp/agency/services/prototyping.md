# Prototyping Service

We will build you a working prototype in two weeks.

The intention of the prototyping service is to help our graduates build a portfolio, showcase their capabilities, and build relationships with clients and potential employers. 

Typically, we offer this service to:

+ Startups looking to create an [MVP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)
+ Businesses looking to test out a new idea
+ Employers looking to recruit developers
+ Any project that may have a positive impact on the world

*What sort of prototypes do you build?*
We build working web applications. In other words, software applications that run in a web browser.

*What about mobile phone apps, for iPhone and Android?*
We can certainly build native apps, but when building a prototype we strongly recommend starting with a browser-based application. Doing it this way will allow you to test your ideas on mobile without blowing your development budget.

*What's the first step?*
You get in touch with us and we'll invite you to discuss your idea with our developers at our campus in Bethnal Green. It is important we understand your idea and what your plans are.

*What happens next?*
If our developers agree that we have a realistic chance of delivering a useful prototype that will meet your expectations, then we will arrange a follow-up meeting with you to agree on a *minimum set of deliverables*, after which we will allocate you the first available start date that is convenient for you.

*How soon will my prototype be delivered?*
Your team will aim to deliver your prototype to the agreed specification within approximately 10 working days of the agreed start date, but if it takes longer you will not be charged more.

*What happens if I want further work done on my prototype?*
Our developers are free agents and we encourage you to retain some or all of your development team to continue to work on your project on a freelance or permanent basis after delivery of the prototype.

*Who owns the IP on my prototype?*
You will own the intellectual property. Your development team will handover all the software, documented and tested on completion of the project.

*What support do you provide after delivery of the prototype?*
After a grace period during which you can report any bugs in the delivered software, you will need to retain one or more of the team on a freelance basis to get continued support.

*What is the advantage of this service?*
The great advantage of this service is that it will give you an opportunity to work with some very talented developers early in their careers. If you are looking to hire developers or build a team for a new project, you are unlikely to find a better source of affordable talent in London.

*What if I am past the MVP or prototype stage and am ready to build a scalable, fully-functioning application?*
We recommend that you contact the [dwyl](http://dwyl.io) agency, who we work closely with in developing our curriculum and where several of our mentors and alumni work.

*How do I find out more?*
Please [contact us](#contactsection) to discuss your project.
