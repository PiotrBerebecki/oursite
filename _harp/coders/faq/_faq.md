# Coding Bootcamp FAQ

**What is the Founders & Coders programme?**    
It is a 16-week programme of study in software development for the web.  

**How frequently do your programmes run?**  
We run three programmes a year, starting in February, June, and October. Exact dates will be confirmed nearer the time, so check back regularly for updates.  

**What is the aim of the programme?**    
To give students sufficient skills to create web applications and find employment as a web developer.

**What is the programme length?**    
It consists of a 16-week foundation followed by up to 10 weeks working on real-world projects.

**How is the foundation course delivered?**    
As a full-time classroom-based course running Monday to Friday from 10am to 7pm at our campus in Bethnal Green.

**How is the classroom organised?**  
Classes are peer-led and project-based with sixteen students working in four teams of four. Students take turns to deliver seminars, run code reviews and manage projects. With direction and guidance from our mentors, members of the cohort will spend time both learning from and teaching each other. Depending on your level of preparation, you may spend more time doing one or the other. We consider teaching to be part of the process of learning.

**What does the curriculum cover?**    
Primarily, we cover *test-driven* development, using *JavaScript* and *Node.js*. We also cover aspects of UX design, product management and entrepreneurship.

**Why JavaScript?**  
JavaScript is the language of the Web. It is the only language that is widely used for both front and back-end development. If you want to be a Web developer, JavaScript will be useful to you wherever you go.

**What projects will I work on after completion of the foundation?**  
We aim to give you an opportunity to work on a variety of open source, charitable and social enterprise projects through our digital accelerator programmes. 

**Will I be able to earn a living as after I complete the programme?**  
After completion of the 16-week programme we aim to offer a living income while you build a project portfolio.  The employment success rate of recent alumni is very high and we will do everything that we can to help youy find employment when you are ready to move on.

**What are the main reasons to apply for this programme?**     
The quality of the learning experience. The commitment of your fellow students. The *Founders & Coders* community.

**Who is this programme suitable for?**    
There are no academic requirements, but you need to be self-motivated, prepared to work long hours, and committed to collaborative working. Coding also requires a deep curiosity about how things work and a certain stubbornness in the face of repeated failure.

**Do you accept applications from abroad?**  
We do welcome international students onto our programme as long as they are intending to stay and work in the host cities after they graduate. The programme is provided free and in return we expect you to contribute to our community after you coplete the 16-week foundation. 

**Why are the prerequisites so tough?**    
This programme is challenging and you need to be well-prepared. We aim for a zero drop-out rate, so we need to know that you are serious about becoming a developer before we accept you on to the programme.

**How competitive is the entry?**    
Very. We get many applicants for each place.

**How much does it cost?**     
There are no fees, but graduates are expected to contribute to the sustainability of the programme after they graduate.

**How are students expected to contribute to the sustainability of the programme?**  
By delivering the programme to the next student cohort and also by allowing us to help them find employment after they graduate.

**Can I get a loan for covering living expenses?**   
In the UK, we are a registered Learning Provider for [Professional and Career Development Loans](https://www.gov.uk/career-development-loans) (PCDL) with registration number REG01-21442. 

**How are you supporting yourselves?**    
Primarily, through fees earned from employers, but also from voluntary contributions from graduates who choose to find their own employment.

**If this programme is so good, why are you offering it for free?**    
We are trying to build an international community and we do not think we can do that by charging an entry fee.
