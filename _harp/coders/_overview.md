## Welcome to the future of learning

Founders & Coders runs tuition-free coding schools in London (since 2014) and Nazareth (beginning Spring 2017). We transform talented individuals from a variety of academic and professional backgrounds into sought-after software developers. All of our graduates find well-paid employment in software development or a related field.

Our revolutionary peer-led programme begins with a 16-week immersion in full-stack JavaScript, Node.js, and Git. Working collaboratively in pairs and teams, students master the fundamentals of “agile” development practices by delivering real projects to clients such as early-stage startups and NGOs. 

Instead of traditional top-down instruction, Founders & Coders has mentors&mdash;former students who work from the Founders & Coders co-working space on freelance projects until they are ready to seek full-time employment.
