## Programme schedule

We run three programmes a year, starting in February, June, and October. The programme consists of a 16-week foundation followed by up to 10 weeks of working on real-world projects.

Classes are peer-led and project-based with sixteen students working in four teams of four. Students take turns delivering seminars, running code reviews and managing projects.

Our curriculum primarily covers test-driven development, using JavaScript and Node.js. We also cover aspects of UX design, product management and entrepreneurship.

After graduation, we aim to help our students find freelance projects, so that they can hone their skills, build a project portfolio and mentor the next cohort of students 

Our London programme is based at our campus in Bethnal Green and runs Monday through Friday from 10 AM to 7 PM. Our Nazareth programme runs Sunday through Thursday from 10 AM to 7 PM.
