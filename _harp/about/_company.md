# About us

Founders & Coders C.I.C. is a nonprofit company. Since 2014, we have been running a full-stack JavaScript coding camp in London. In 2017, we will be opening our first international campus in the city of Nazareth. This is our first step in propagating our model of high-quality, low-cost training around the world. 

## Coding bootcamps

Our coding bootcamps employ no teaching staff and our students pay no fees. They are an expression of our belief in the power of peer-led learning to build bridges between people and in the power of software to help provide creative solutions to the worldâ€™s economic and social challenges. 

## Digital accelerators

When our students graduate, we expect them to work on projects that have high social impact. Through our digital accelerator programme, we work closely with charities, social enterprises and startups to achieve that aim.
