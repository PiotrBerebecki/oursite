# Founders & Coders

Since 2014, Founders & Coders has been running a full-stack JavaScript coding camp in London. In 2017, we will be opening our first international campus in the city of Nazareth.

We follow a highly-effective peer-led approach to learning and we do not employ any teaching or administrative staff. 

Thanks to the dedication and effort of our management team, we are currently able to offer our training without charging any fees to our students.

Nearly every one of our graduates finds a software development role. Every one of our 48 students in the last year has found work in software development or a related field.

Our coding camps are an expression of our belief in the power of peer-led learning to build bridges between people and to help provide creative solutions to the worldâ€™s economic and social challenges.

**Charities, social enterprises and startups**  

In parallel with our coding camp, we run an agile product development and training service for charities, social enterprises and early-stage startups. We run product design workshops with our clients and then we assign them a team of our graduate developers, who work with them over a period of several weeks to plan, develop and test their minimal viable product.
