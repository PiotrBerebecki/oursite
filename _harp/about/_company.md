# Founders & Coders

Founders & Coders C.I.C. is a non-profit company. Since 2014, we have been running a full-stack JavaScript coding camp in London. 

We expect our graduates to work on projects that have high social impact and we work closely with charities, social enterprises and startups to achieve that aim.

Nearly every one of our graduates finds a software development role. Every one of our 48 students in the last year has found work in software development or a related field.

We follow a highly-effective peer-led approach to learning, we do not employ any teaching or administrative staff, and we do not charge student fees. 
 
In 2017, we will be opening our first international campus in the city of Nazareth. This is our first step in propagating our model of high-quality, low-cost training around the world.

Our coding camps are an expression of our belief in the power of peer-led learning to build bridges between people and in the power of software to help provide creative solutions to the worldâ€™s economic and social challenges.

**Charities, social enterprises and startups**  

In parallel with our coding camp, we run a product development and training service for charities, social enterprises and early-stage startups, for whom we run product design workshops and provide agile development teams.

**Partners**  
These programmes would not be possible without the support of [dwyl](http://www.dwyl.io/), who provide freelance employment to many of our graduates, [CAST](http://www.wearecast.org.uk/), who we partner with on charity projects, and [UK Israel Tech Hub](http://www.ukisraelhub.com/) who are supporting our work in Nazareth.
