# About us

Founders & Coders runs a well-established full-stack JavaScript coding camp in London. In 2017 we plan to open our first international campus in the Arab Israeli city of Nazareth.

We follow a highly-effective peer-led approach to learning and we do not employ any teaching or administrative staff. Thanks to the dedication and effort of our two directors, we are currently able to offer our training without charging any fees to our students.

The 16-week programme is project-based. Starting with a 10-week foundation course, our students then go on to work with charities and early-stage startups to find creative technical solutions to real-world problems.

After students have completed four months of training, they continue to work with us, usually for at least two months, on a variety of projects provided through our partners, while helping us to mentor the next cohort of students.

We cover a curriculum of test-driven development using JavaScript and Node.js, we follow agile software development practices and we train the charities and startups that we work with in the lean methods that we use.

Nearly every one of our graduates finds a software development role. Every one of our 48 students in the last year has found work in software development or a related field.

Our coding camps are an expression of our belief in the power of peer-led study to build bridges between people and to help provide creative solutions to the worldâ€™s economic and social challenges.

These programmes would not be possible without the support of [dwyl](http://www.dwyl.io/), who provide freelance employment to many of our graduates, [CAST](http://www.wearecast.org.uk/), who we partner with on charity projects, and [UK Israel Tech Hub](http://www.ukisraelhub.com/) who are supporting our work in Nazareth.
