# About us

Founders & Coders C.I.C. runs the only free full-time coding course in the UK. We have developed a highly effective peer-led model of learning which, after only two years of operation, attracts exceptional women and men from all over the world.

After completing the course, students are encouraged to become a part of our freelance community and to contribute to a growing array of community activities, including the course itself.

Our Autumn 2015 cohort had a 100% programme completion record and all of them are now working as software developers. In the 12 months to April 2016, 17 (36%) out of 47 students completing our programme were women.

We support ourselves entirely through voluntary contributions from our alumni, through placement fees from employers, and through our close working relationship with [dwyl](http://www.dwyl.io/), which provides freelance experience to many of our graduates.

We believe this to be a replicable model of training that is capable of addressing acute skills shortages, widening access to work opportunities, and offering life-changing personal empowerment free at the point of delivery and without ongoing subsidies.

We are now partnering with a number of organisations to provide freelancing and employment opportunities in the social enterprise and charity sectors for our graduates and to open new schools that follow our model elsewhere in the UK and abroad.
