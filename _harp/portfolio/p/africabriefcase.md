##Challenge

In this foundational project, we partnered with Revolution Works, in association with <a href="https://www.africamedialab.com/" target="_blank">Africa Media Lab</a>.

Revolution Works needed a service which would allow freelance journalists, working around the world, to create journalistic material. They needed editors to be able to curate and publish that material in beautiful collections of articles.

##Solution
After the production of meticulous wireframes and user stories, the project began with the production of an alpha application. Starting from this foundation, the team worked in fortnightly sprints, using agile principles until completion. Our processes ensured quality, timing and flexibility.

Founders and Coders have a continued partnership with Revolution Works.
