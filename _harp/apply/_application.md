# Your application

Think Founders & Coders might be for you? Complete the [Expression of interest](interest.html) today. It takes two minutes and allows you to be a part of our online community. 

Applications for the February cohorts open on **November 1st**. 

## Preparing your Application

We have no minimum criteria for application, but you are unlikely to secure a place on the programme without a considerable amount of prior effort. Successful applicants with no previous programming experience, typically undertake 200+ hours of self-study.

There are a number of ways to demonstrate your readiness for the programme:

+ Completing and creating JavaScript kata on [Codewars](http://www.codewars.com/?language=javascript)
+ Making progress with [Free Code Camp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/) *
+ Creating your own website using [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) *
+ Participation in one of our [Meetup groups](http://www.meetup.com/founderscoders/)

\* Note: While learning CSS and JavaScript, we recommend against using frameworks like Bootstrap and jQuery.

## Suggested targets

Get up to 5kyu or more and create some of your own kata on Codewars or, alternatively, progress up to the *Advanced Algorithm Scripting* level and complete some of the *Advanced Front End Development Projects* on Free Code Camp.

If you are not comfortable coding at this standard by the time the course starts you may struggle. The tasks above are part of how we will measure whether you are a good candidate for the course as well as whether you can learn in the collaborative environment here. 

Please be aware that meeting our suggested targets will not necessarily secure you a place. Our programme is highly collaborative and we take great care to achieve a diversity of skills and backgrounds on each cohort. Our aim is to create the best _team_ learning environment for every cohort, not to simply have a set of great _individuals_.

If you have no coding experience, we encourage you to seek help and encouragement from our online community on  [Gitter](https://gitter.im/codingforeveryone). It's a friendly place. Beginners are always welcome.  

## Other recommended materials

[A Guide to setting up your developer environment](https://github.com/dwyl/dev-setup) by our good friends at dwyl is an excellent starting point for new developers.

Udacity has several good courses, including [JavaScript Basics](https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-basics--ud804), [Object-Oriented JavaScript](https://www.udacity.com/course/object-oriented-javascript--ud015) and [How to Use Git and GitHub](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775).

[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing) is an excellent resource for complete beginners. We love their introduction to Computer Science as well as their JavaScript-based programming course.

[Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) is another good resource for complete beginners. We recommend [HTML & CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/web), [Make a Website](https://www.codecademy.com/en/skills/make-a-website), [JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript) and the [YouTube API](https://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/youtube).

[Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/Eloquent_JavaScript.pdf) is a great self-contained introduction to Javascript. The first 4 chapters are relatively easy to follow. Subsequent chapters cover more advanced topics.

[Internet History, Technology, and Security](https://www.coursera.org/learn/internet-history) on Coursera provides a nice bit of historical context.

[Javascript: The Good Parts](http://bdcampbell.net/javascript/book/javascript_the_good_parts.pdf) is written by the godfather of Javascript, Douglas Crockford, but later chapters can be hard to follow.

[Crockford on JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxAXlJEmNMg&list=PL7664379246A246CB), particularly Parts 2 and 3. A wonderful series of lectures by Crockford. A panoramic overview of JavaScript at an advanced level. These talks are hard to follow, but anything you can take from them is valuable.

[JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts - The First 3.5 Hours](https://youtu.be/Bv_5Zv5c-Ts). The full course is on Udemy, but the first bit is free on YouTube and well worth watching.

[CSS Diner](http://flukeout.github.io/) is a fun way to reinforce CSS selectors.

[Typing Club](https://www.typingclub.com/) is good (and free). It would help greatly for you to be a relatively quick typist. 

Finally, sign up to Stack Overflow and look at some answers given for Javascript questions. The community can be a little intolerant of duplicated questions, but it is really worth the effort of trying to ask (or even answer!) some questions yourself.

**Reading**  
[Paul Ford - What is Code?](http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/) is a great article about his impression of the tech industry and the life of a programmer. It's long, but quite light to read.

[Steve Yegge's Google platforms rant](https://plus.google.com/+RipRowan/posts/eVeouesvaVX) shows you how passionate someone can be about their tech company's philosophy.

**Watching**  
[Inventing on Principle](https://vimeo.com/36579366), a talk by Bret Victor.

[Computer Science: Past, Present, and Future](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Tk09c0FQ3M&feature=youtu.be), a talk by Ed Lazowska.

[The Future Doesn't Have to Be Incremental](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTAghAJcO1o&feature=youtu.be), a talk by Alan Kay.

Anything with Douglas Crockford in!
