# Your application

Applications for our February cohorts opens on November 1st and close on November 30th for London and on December 31st for Nazareth. You may submit your application at any time between these dates and can continue working on prerequisites until the deadline.

## Course prerequisites

### STEP 1

Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.

### STEP 2

Complete the  [Expression of interest](interest.html) form. 

Wait to receive an invitation to join https://github.com/codingforeveryone.

When you receive the invitation you know that your expression of interest has been received. 

If you do not receive an invitation within 7 days, please re-submit your Expression of Interest, checking that you have entered your GitHub username accurately.

### STEP 3

Join [our Gitter group](https://gitter.im/codingforeveryone) and introduce yourself.

### STEP 4

Sign up for [our Meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/founderscoders/).

If you live outside London or Nazareth, ask us about setting up a meetup in your home town.

### STEP 5

Join [Free Code Camp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/).

If you have not done any programming before, then you will probably need to allow yourself a minimum of 100 hours on *Front End Development* before you are ready to tackle *Codewars*.

### STEP 6

Join [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/).

Aim to get to at least *5 kyu* by the time the application window closes.

Create at least one Codewars [kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/new/javascript).

### STEP 7

Create a personal website using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) 

Note: We recommend not using a framework like Bootstrap. Also, using Jekyll is entirely optional.


## Application instructions

### STEP 1

Prepare an application video that answers these questions:

1. Why do you want to do join the programme?
1. How would you like to use technology to help others?
1. What do you intend to do when you finish?
1. What really motivates you?
1. If we could open a Founders & Coders anywhere else in the world, where would you want it to be?

Please: 

- Keep it to under two minutes. 
- Use Youtube or Vimeo or a similar service.
- Record your voice at an adequate sound level.

### STEP 2

When applications open, complete the application form. Your application will be considered only after the closing date for applications, so you can continue to work on the prerequisites until that date. 

You can expect to hear from us within 14 days of the application closing date.
