# Applications

The Autumn 2016 programme starts on Monday 17th October. 

Applications close on **Friday 19th August**.

## The application process

+ [Application form, Part 1](apply1.html) (the shorter one)
+ [Application form, Part 2](apply2.html) (the longer one)

We may also request a short in-person paired programming session (remote sessions can also be arranged).

We offer places throughout the months leading up to the application deadline. Early application is recommended, so we know that you are interested and can keep an eye out for you in our community.

## Minimum application requirements

We will expect you to have started on your journey to become a software developer before you join us on the programme. Our minimum requirements provide the guidance you need to achieve this:

+ Reach at least 5 kyu on [Codewars](http://www.codewars.com/?language=javascript);
+ Create some kata on [CodeWars](http://www.codewars.com/kata/new);
+ Contribute to [our community on GitHub](https://github.com/codingforeveryone)
(e.g. our [READMEs](https://github.com/codingforeveryone/READMEs));
+ Remain active in [our Gitter chatrooms](https://gitter.im/codingforeveryone)

Your application will not be considered until you have met all these requirements.

If you have no coding experience, creating kata on Codewars and getting familiar with GitHub will take time, but please do not be daunted. 

We encourage you to seek help and encouragement from other applicants. Join us on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/codingforeveryone). We encourage you to start by asking questions. It's a friendly community. Beginners are always welcome.  

Please be aware that meeting the minimum criteria alone will not secure you a place. Our course is highly collaborative and as such, we take great care to also achieve a diversity of skills and backgrounds on each cohort. Our aim is to create the best _team_ learning environment for every cohort, not to simply have a set of great _individuals_.

Please also note that this programme is intended for people without a background in computer science or software engineering. If you have already worked professionally as a software engineer or studied computer science at university, then this programme is probably not for you.
