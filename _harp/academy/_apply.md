# Applications

Our June 2016 course is now full, thank you to all who applied!

We are now taking applications up until 5th September for our October course, based at our Bethnal Green campus.

## The application process

+ [Application form, Part 1](apply1.html) (the shorter one)
+ [Application form, Part 2](apply2.html) (the longer one)

We may also request a short in-person paired programming session (remote sessions can also be arranged).

We offer places on throughout the months leading up to the application deadline, so we strongly recommend that you apply early, regardless of whether you have met the minimum application criteria. This way we'll know you are interested and can keep an eye out for you in our community.

Your application will remain open either until you have been offered a place or until all the places have been filled, which is likely to be on or before September 7th.

## Minimum application requirements

We receive many applications for each place and selection is highly competitive, but also based on a wide range of factors. Our aim is to create the best _team_ learning environment for every cohort, not to simply have a set of great _individuals_.

We will expect you to have started on your journey to become a software developer before you join us on the programme. Our minimum requirements provide the guidance you need to achieve this:

+ For your application video, record your voice at an adequate sound level and keep it to under two minutes;
+ Reach at least 5 kyu on [Codewars](http://www.codewars.com/?language=javascript);
+ Create some kata on [CodeWars](http://www.codewars.com/kata/new);
+ Contribute to [our community on GitHub](https://github.com/codingforeveryone)
(e.g. our [READMEs](https://github.com/codingforeveryone/READMEs));
+ Contribute to [our Gitter chatroom](https://gitter.im/codingforeveryone)

Your application will not be considered until you have met all these requirements.

If you have no coding experience, creating kata on Codewars and getting familiar with GitHub will take time, but please do not be daunted. 

We encourage you to seek help and encouragement from other applicants. Join us on GitHub, and use our [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/codingforeveryone).

Please be aware that meeting the minimum criteria alone will not secure a place. Achieving high scores on Codewars and active participation on Gitter and GitHub are helpful to an application, but not necessarily decisive. 

Our course is highly collaborative and as such, we take great care to also achieve a diversity of skills and backgrounds on each cohort in order to create the best learning environment.
