# Applications

The Spring 2017 programme starts on Monday 20th February. 

Applications will open on November 1st and close on November 30th.

## The application process

+ **[Expression of interest](interest.html)** - takes two minutes to complete.
+ Application - opening on November 1st.

We will expect you to have started on your journey to become a software developer before you join us on the programme.

There are a number of ways to demonstrate your readiness for the programme:

+ Completing and creating JavaScript kata on [Codewars](http://www.codewars.com/?language=javascript)
+ Making progress with [Free Code Camp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/) *
+ Creating your own website using [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) *
+ Participation in one of our [Meetup groups](http://www.meetup.com/founderscoders/)

\* While learning CSS and JavaScript, we recommend against using frameworks like Bootstrap and jQuery.

We have no minimum criteria for application, but you are unlikely to secure a place on the programme without a considerable amount of prior effort. 100-200 hours of self-study is probably typical. 

5kyu or more on Codewars or, alternatively, completing *Advanced Algorithm Scripting* and some of the *Advanced Front End Development Projects* on Free Code Camp would be good targets to aim for.

If you have no coding experience, we encourage you to seek help and encouragement from our online community on  [Gitter](https://gitter.im/codingforeveryone). It's a friendly place. Beginners are always welcome.  

Please be aware that meeting our suggested targets will not necessarily secure you a place. Our programme is highly collaborative and we take great care to achieve a diversity of skills and backgrounds on each cohort. Our aim is to create the best _team_ learning environment for every cohort, not to simply have a set of great _individuals_.
