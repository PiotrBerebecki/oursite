# Applications

We are now taking applications for the Autummn 2016 cohort (starting in October), based at our Bethnal Green campus.

## The application process

+ [Application form, Part 1](apply1.html) (the shorter one)
+ [Application form, Part 2](apply2.html) (the longer one)

We may also request a short in-person paired programming session (remote sessions can also be arranged).

We offer places on a rolling basis. Early application is recommended.

## Minimum application requirements

We will expect you to have started on your journey to become a software developer before you join us on the programme. These are the minimum requirements:

+ Reach at least 5 kyu on [Codewars](http://www.codewars.com/?language=javascript);
+ Create some kata on [CodeWars](http://www.codewars.com/kata/new);
+ Contribute to [our community on GitHub](https://github.com/codingforeveryone)
(e.g. our [READMEs](https://github.com/codingforeveryone/READMEs));
+ Remain active in [our Gitter chatrooms](https://gitter.im/codingforeveryone)

Your application will not be considered until you have met all these requirements.

If you have no coding experience, creating kata on Codewars and getting familiar with GitHub will take time, but please do not be daunted. 

We encourage you to seek help and encouragement from other applicants. Join us on GitHub, and ask questions on Gitter.

Please note that this programme is intended for people without a background in computer science or software engineering. If you have already worked professionally as a software engineer or studied computer science at university, then this programme is probably not for you.
