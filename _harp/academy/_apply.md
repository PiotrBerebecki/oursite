Candidates can apply whenever they want, but their application will not be considered until they have met all the prerequisites, after which they will receive feedback within a week of the subsequent application deadline and will remain in the applicant pool either until they have been offered a place or until all the places have been filled.

## Application criteria

We receive many applications for each place and selection is highly competitive. we will expect you to have started on your journey to become a software developer before you join us on the programme.

+ Apply early
+ Record your voice at an adequate sound level on your video and keep it to under two minutes;
+ Reach at least 5 kyu on [Codewars](http://www.codewars.com/?language=javascript);
+ Create some kata on [CodeWars](http://www.codewars.com/kata/new);
+ Contribute to [our community on GitHub](https://github.com/codingforeveryone)
(we will send you an invitation to join when you complete Part 1 of the application);
+ contribute to [our Gitter chatroom](https://gitter.im/codingforeveryone)

If you have no coding experience, creating kata on Codewars, getting familiar with GitHub, and getting to the point where you feel comfortable asking questions on Stackoverflow will take time.

But please do not be daunted. We encourage you to seek help and encouragement from other applicants. Join us on GitHub, use our Gitter channel, and if you live in London consider signing up for our [Monday evening meetups](http://www.meetup.com/founderscoders/).
