# The programme

Founders & Coders runs what is probably the most challenging course of its kind in the UK: An eight-week, full-time foundation course in software development for the Web, followed by another eight weeks building a portfolio and then the possibility of a further eight weeks helping us deliver the course to our next cohort of students, while continuing to sharpen your skills as a developer.
