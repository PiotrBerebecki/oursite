# The programme

<img src="/assets/fac-logo.png" class="fac-logo">

Founders & Coders runs an intensive full-time, 16-week course in full-stack software development using JavaScript and Node.js. Application is highly-selective and we take just 16 students per cohort. After graduation, we expect all of our students to help us deliver the course to the next cohort and to contribute to our various community projects.

<!-- We encourage applications from demographics that are underrepresented in the tech industry, particularly women.  -->
