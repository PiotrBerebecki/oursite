# FAQ

**What is the Founders & Coders programme?**    
It is a 16-week programme of study in software development for the web.

**What is the aim of the programme?**    
To give students sufficient skills to create web applications and find employment as a developer.

**What is the structure of the programme?**    
It is divided into two parts: an eight-week foundation course followed by eight weeks working on real-world projects.

**How is the foundation course delivered?**    
As a full-time classroom-based course running Monday to Friday from 10am to 7pm at our campus in Bethnal Green.

**How is the classroom organised?**     
Courses are peer-led and project-based with sixteen students working in four teams of four. Students take turns to deliver seminars, run code reviews and manage projects.

**What does the curriculum cover?**    
Primarily, we cover *test-driven* development, using *JavaScript* and *Node.js*. We also cover aspects of UX design, product management and entrepreneurship.

**What projects will I work on in the second half of the programme?**  
That will be up to you. Working together, it is the responsibility of each cohort of students to find their own clients. In the first half of the programme, we will set aside time each week to help you develop and execute a business development plan.

**What are the main reasons to apply for this programme?**     
The quality of the learning experience. The commitment of your fellow students. The *Founders & Coders* community.

**Who is this programme suitable for?**    
There are no academic requirements, but you need to be self-motivated, prepared to work long hours, and committed to collaborative working. Coding also requires a deep curiosity about how things work and a certain stubbornness in the face of repeated failure.

**Why are the prerequisites so tough**    
This programme is challenging and you need to be well-prepared. We aim for a zero drop-out rate, so we need to know that you are serious about becoming a developer before we accept you on to the programme. 

**How competitive is the entry?**    
Very. We get many applicants for each place.

**How much does it cost?**     
There are no fees.

**Will I be paid for the projects?**    
If we execute a successful business development plan together, then yes, you can expect to receive modest remuneration from your clients. We aim for around Â£50/day in the second half of the programme.

**Do you get paid for the projects?**    
We make no money from student projects. All payments recieved from clients go to the students after completion of each project.

**How are you supporting yourselves?**    
By working on freelance projects and delivering commercial training programmes. None of us is paid for teaching or mentoring on the programme.

**If this programme is so good, why are you offering it for free?**    
We are trying to build a community and we do not think we can do that by charging an entry fee.

**How can I give something back?**    
After the 16-week programme is finished, you can help us by joining the *Founders & Coders* co-operative, by mentoring on the programme, by finding projects for us to work on, and by continuing to work on projects with us.
