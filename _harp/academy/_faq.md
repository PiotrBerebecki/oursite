It is a 16-week programme of study in software development for the web.  

**Do you run multiple programmes every year?**  
We run three programmes a year - from January, May, and September. Exact dates get confirmed nearer the time so check back regularly for updates.  

**What is the aim of the programme?**    
To give students sufficient skills to create web applications and find employment as a web developer.

**What is the structure of the programme?**    
It is divided into two parts: a 10-week foundation followed by 6 weeks working on real-world projects.

**How is the foundation course delivered?**    
As a full-time classroom-based course running Monday to Friday from 10am to 7pm at our campus in Bethnal Green.

**How is the classroom organised?**     
Courses are peer-led and project-based with sixteen students working in four teams of four. Students take turns to deliver seminars, run code reviews and manage projects.

**What does the curriculum cover?**    
Primarily, we cover *test-driven* development, using *JavaScript* and *Node.js*. We also cover aspects of UX design, product management and entrepreneurship.

**What projects will I work on in the second part of the programme?**  
We aim to give you an opportunity to work on a variety of open source, charitable, social enterprise, startup and commercial projects. The programme is under continuous development and the balance between learning and earning a living is always under review.  

**What are the main reasons to apply for this programme?**     
The quality of the learning experience. The commitment of your fellow students. The *Founders & Coders* community.

**Who is this programme suitable for?**    
There are no academic requirements, but you need to be self-motivated, prepared to work long hours, and committed to collaborative working. Coding also requires a deep curiosity about how things work and a certain stubbornness in the face of repeated failure.  

**Do you accept non-UK citizens on the course?**  
We do welcome international students onto the course as long as they are intending to stay and work in London after they graduate. The course is provided free and in return we expect you to contribute to our community. You will need to be eligible to study and work in the UK. We are currently unable to provide assistance with visas or accommodation.  

**Why are the prerequisites so tough?**    
This programme is challenging and you need to be well-prepared. We aim for a zero drop-out rate, so we need to know that you are serious about becoming a developer before we accept you on to the programme. 

**How competitive is the entry?**    
Very. We get many applicants for each place.

**How much does it cost?**     
There are no fees, but students and graduates are expected to help us deliver the course to the next cohort and to contribute to our various community projects.

**How are you supporting yourselves?**    
By working on freelance projects. None of us is paid for teaching or mentoring on the programme.

**If this programme is so good, why are you offering it for free?**    
We are trying to build a community and we do not think we can do that by charging an entry fee.

**How can I give something back?**    
Almost as soon as you arrive, we will invite you to get involved in helping us run our various free programmes. After the 16-week programme is finished, we will expect you to help us deliver the programme to our next cohort of students.
